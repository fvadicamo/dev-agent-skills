## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-20

### Changed

#### github-pr-review
- Added CodeRabbit severity detection to `references/severity_guide.md`: emoji+italic pattern (`_⚠️ Potential issue_`, `_🧹 Nitpick_`, `_🔧 Optional_`, etc.), secondary color badges (`_🟡 Minor_`, `_🟠 Major_`) as binding severity indicator
- Documented CodeRabbit "outside diff" comments pattern: embedded in PR-level review body `<details>` blocks, not in `pulls/$PR/comments`
- Step 1: added `pulls/$PR/reviews` fetch alongside `pulls/$PR/comments` to capture outside diff comments
- Step 1: replaced raw fetch commands with inline `--jq` filters to avoid `!=` operator, which Claude Code's Bash tool escapes as `\!=` breaking jq
- Updated severity table in step 1 with CodeRabbit indicators
- Current PR context now includes milestone: `PR #N: title (state) | Milestone: name`
- Added step 7: verify milestone at end of review; suggest assigning if missing and open milestones exist (never assigns automatically)

#### github-pr-creation
- Added `.s2s/plans/*.md` to task documentation search paths (Spec2Ship projects)
- Added `chore/*`, `ci/*`, `docs/*` branch patterns to title prefix table
- Added breaking change handling: add `breaking` label + `## Breaking changes` body section
- Added step 9: detect open milestones and assign if exactly one is active; ask user if multiple exist
- Updated `gh pr create` command with `--milestone`, `--reviewer`, correct multi-`--label` syntax
- Added `--draft` usage note (WIP, CI wait, AI bot trigger)

#### github-pr-merge
- Added step 2: check PR milestone before merge; warn (not block) if open milestones exist but PR has none
- Added milestone line to pre-merge checklist summary (step 4)
- Added step 7: after merge, check `open_issues` on milestone; offer to close it if all items are done
- Renumbered steps: old 2→3, 3→4, 4→5, 5→6; new steps are 2 and 7
